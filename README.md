Hydra
====

![Hydra!](http://github.com/filmaj/hydra/raw/master/img/icon128.png)

A beast with many heads. Keep one or more PhoneGap app assets "in the cloud" on
[build.phonegap.com](http://build.phonegap.com), and use this shell to
store different apps and keep each app up-to-date with the latest
assets.

Requirements
----

This project _must_ be built on [build.phonegap.com](http://build.phonegap.com),
and your account must have plugin support enabled. Contact [sales@nitobi.com](mailto:sales@nitobi.com)
if you have questions about this.

Platforms supported: Android

Getting Started
----

1. Upload this project as an application to [build.phonegap.com](http://build.phonegap.com).
2. Install the generated application on your phone.
3. Run Hydra.
4. You will see a form for entering an application ID along with your [build.phonegap.com](http://build.phonegap.com) credentials. Do that!
5. Your app will download and get loaded into the current app.
6. Next time you run Hydra, you can load any app that you had Hydra pull down. Every time you do, Hydra will check whether a newer version exists on [build.phonegap.com](http://build.phonegap.com).

Why?
----

* Easier to manage application updates; a poor man's TestFlight.
* Theoretically more secure. However: be warned I don't know shit about
  security.
